    <h2>These are the places that make me the happiest</h2>

    <p><div class="container"><img src="img/crater lake.jpg" alt="Picture of Crater Lake" heigh="400" width="450"></div></p>
    <h3>Crater Lake</h3>
    <p>Crater Lake is one of the most beautiful places I have been to.</p>
    <p>You can learn more about them over at their <a href= "https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm">website </a>.</p>

    <p><img src="img/Sagrada Familia.jpg" alt="Tooth Pic Sculpture of Sagrada Familia" height="400" width="450"></p>
    <h3>Sagrada Familia</h3>
    <p>I have seen many churches and many impressive feats of human engineering.</p>
    <p>The Sagrada Familia is the most impressive of them all. Learn
    more <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia">here</a>.</p>
    <p>This is actually a tooth pick scultupre that someone made of it. That was also impressive.</p>

    <p><img src="img/redwoods.jpg" alt="Redwood Trees" height="650" width="450"></p>
    <h3>The Redwoods</h3>
    <p>There is something very calming about hiking in a forest that is <em>hundreds</em> of years old.</p>

    <p><img src="img/myhouse.jpg" alt="My House" height="600" width "450"></p>
    <h3>My House</h3>
    <p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention my house. This isn't the best picture but at the end
    of the day there really is no place like home.</p>
