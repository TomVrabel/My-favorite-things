    <h3>Crater Lake</h3>
    <p class="break">Crater Lake is one of the most beautiful places I have been to. You can learn more about them over at their <a href= "https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm">website</a>.</p>

    <p><img class="container" src="img/Sagrada Familia.jpg" alt="Tooth Pic Sculpture of Sagrada Familia"></p>
    <h3>Sagrada Familia</h3>
    <p class="break">I have seen many <span class="church"> churches </span> and many impressive feats of human engineering.The Sagrada Familia is the most impressive of them all. Learn
    more <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia">here</a>. This is actually a tooth pick scultupre that someone made of it. That was also impressive.</p>

    <p><img class="container" src="img/redwoods.jpg" alt="Redwood Trees"></p>
    <h3>The Redwoods</h3>
    <p class="break">There is something very calming about hiking in a forest that is <em>hundreds</em> of years old.</p>

    <p><img class="container"src="img/myhouse.jpg" alt="My House"></p>
    <h3>My House</h3>
    <p class="break">I would be remiss if I didn't mention my house. This isn't the best picture but at the end
    of the day there really is no place like home.</p>
